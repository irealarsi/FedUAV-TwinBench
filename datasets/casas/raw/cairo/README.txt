at least one occasion.

The following activities are annotated within the dataset. The number in
parentheses is the number of times the activity appears in the data.

The sensor events are generated from motion sensors (these sensor IDs begin
with "M") and temperature sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "T").
The layout of the sensors in the home is shown in the file Cairo.png.
