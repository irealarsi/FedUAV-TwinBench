WSU Smart Apartment Summer 2009 Two Resident Testbed

Description

This dataset represents sensor events collected in the WSU smart apartment
testbed during the summer of 2009.  The apartment housed two residents, R1
and R2, at this time and they performed their normal daily activities.

File format

Two data files are included in this release.  The file "annotated" contains
sensor events in which the start and end of various activities are
annotated at the end of the corresponding sensor event lines.

The second "raw" file contains raw data that has not been annotated.  The number
of days covered and number of sensor events is greater than for the annotated
data.

The third file "data" contains all of the annotated where activities are not
segmented but are annotated with corresponding begin and end events.

Sensor layouts

The sensors can be categorized by:

   Mxx:       motion sensor
   Ixx:       item sensor for selected items in the kitchen
   Dxx:       door sensor
   AD1-A:     burner sensor
   AD1-B:     hot water sensor
   AD1-C:     cold water sensor
   Txx:       temperature sensors
   P001:      electricity usage

The sensor layout of the apartment for the annotated data set is shown in the
file sensorlayout.jpg.  The sensor layout of the apartment for the raw data set
is shown in the file sensorlayout2.png.  The sensors are the same but some
renumbering was done and the power usage was added.

All use of the data must cite the WSU CASAS smart home project.
